   Need help deciding somewhere to eat for breakfast?

Browse a selection of Denver breakfast and brunch restaurants to help make a decision on where to eat. Don't see a choice you'd like add it in yourself. Then you can use the randomizer feature and let the APP make a decision for you.

## Overview

This was a solo showcase project assigned in week 18 of the Turing School of Software and Design front-end engineering program. The goals of this solo project were to:

* Display competency with React fundamentals
* Create a multi-page UX using Router
* Test React components & asynchronous JS with Cypress
* Practicing refactoring 

## Features:
* Initially created a RESTful API and deployed it on Vercel
* Used React Router to change views 
* Made network requests to the self created RESTful API for data 
* Tested the different browser pages with Cypress, while also stubbing and intercepting network requests.
* A user can add a personal choice, be able to delete it, and favorite any restaurant of their choice. 
* Accessibility: app is fully _tabbable_, and scored 100% on both Lighthouse and WAVE audits

### Installation
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
1. Fork this Repo
2. Clone it down to your machine
3. cd into the root of the project directory
4. Run `npm install`
5. To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal to start the local server. This runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
6. See the section about [deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/) for more information.
7. Enter `Ctrl + C` in your terminal to stop the local server at any time.
