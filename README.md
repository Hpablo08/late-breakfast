## Overview

This was a solo showcase project assigned in week 18 of the Turing School of Software and Design front-end engineering program. The goals of this solo project were to:

* Display competency with React fundamentals
* Create a multi-page UX using Router
* Test React components & asynchronous JS with Cypress
* Practicing refactoring 

## Features:
* Initially created a RESTful API and deployed it on Vercel
* Used React Router to change views 
* Made network requests to the self created RESTful API for data 
* Tested the different browser pages with Cypress, while also stubbing and intercepting network requests.
* Accessibility: app is fully _tabbable_, and scored 100% on both Lighthouse and WAVE audits
